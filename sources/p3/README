This directory contains the files for the "ping-pang-pong" system (which I call 
p3).

Essentially, the packet filter has three agents, which all need access to 
memory:

 - The snooper
 - The CPU
 - The forwarder
 
To allow them all to run in parallel, I have three BRAMS, which I call ping, 
pang, and pong. The goal of the p3 system is to internally connect each of the 
three agents to a BRAM.

The general structure is like this:

                   +-------------------------------------------+
                   |           +---------+                     |

                   |    |      +---------+   |                 |

                   |    |      +---------+   |                 |
+-------------+    |    |                    |    +----------+ |
|  Forwarder  |<--------+                    +--->|   Pong   | |
+-------------+    |                              +----------+ |
                   |                                           |
                   +-------------------------------------------+
                                    P3 System


There is one extra snag: each of the agents has a slightly different interface. 
So, each of the lines from the agents to the MUXes actually has a different 
adapter. So, actually, it's more like:


                   +-------------------------------------------+
                   |           +---------+                     |

                   +-------------------------------------------+
                                    P3 System

where /\ is an adapter.

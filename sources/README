The architecture of the packet filter IP is as follows:



 (wires to                      (new instructions)
 snoop on)                              +
    ||                                  |
    ||       +-------------------------------------------------------+
    ||       |                          |                            |
    ||       |                          v                            |
    ||       | +---------+    +-------------------+    +-----------+ |
    ||       | |         |    |       Filter      |    |           | |
    -========|=| Snooper |--->|                   |--->| Forwarder |-|------> 
    ||       | |         |    |  (parallel_cores) |    |           | | (accepted       
    ||       | +---------+    +-------------------+    +-----------+ |  packets)
    ||       |                                                       |

There are three sub-components:

    - Snooper: this sub-component's job is to observe some wires elsewhere in 
      your design, and copy everything into a buffer in the packetfilter_core.
    
    - filter: this sub-component accepts BPF instructions from an 
      external source, and runs them on packets that were copied in by the 
      snooper. It is made up of several parallel processors. It will signal 
      whether or not each packet was accepted by the program. 
    
    - Forwarder: when the packetfilter_core signals an accepted packet, the 
      forwarder will take care of copying it out of the buffer. For example, 
      this could be done in order to send accepted packets out over a network 
      connection.


There are several reasons to structure the design in this way. First of all, 
it's important to be able to plug in different variations of snoopers and 
forwarders depending on external protocols. The wires you're snooping can have 
many different (possibly custom) communication protocols. Likewise, the place 
where forwarded packets are going could also have many different protocols.

                                ---

There is one sub-directory for each of the components in the above diagram, 
plus one sub-directory called "generic". The "generic" directory contains 
designs that I think have a chance of being usable in other projects.

Anyway, each directory has its own design documentation, so it should be 
reasonably straightforward to understand how everything works. My number one 
goal is for this code to make sense to someone reading it, so I'm definitely 
open to suggestions for improvement. E-mail me at marco.merlini@utoronto.ca

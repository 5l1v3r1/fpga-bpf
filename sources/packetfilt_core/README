These files form the "packet filter core". Essentially, this is the common 
denominator to all the different variations you can make of the packet filter.

Essentially, this is simply a CPU and the P3 system. The exposed interface is:

 - A "BRAM slave" interface to plug in a snooper 
 - A "BRAM slave" interface to plug in a forwarder
 - A "BRAM master" interface where the CPU will fetch its instructions
 - A couple of reset and handshaking signals

First of all, the "BRAM" interfaces are a little non-standard. I also add some 
extra sidechannels for keeping track of the lengths in memory.

But anyway, when you ask for a bunch of parallel processors, it is this 
packetfilt_core module that gets copied.

I wanted to draw a diagram for myself (just to help me visualize while I wrote 
Verilog) and decided that if I was going to do it, I should put in the README.

                     tag rd ak
                      |  |  |         tag_tree.v

In my original project, all the generic stuff was in the same file and it was 
extremely ugly. This is my attempt to clean things up a bit.

Also, potentially, by making this file it will get me thinking about how to do 
the forwarder tree as well.

This is nothing more than a simple (dual-port) BRAM for storing CPU 
instructions.

At least on Xilinx FPGAs, using dual-port BRAMs is essentiaslly free. In my 
case, it simplifies the design. Otherwise, I would have to multiplex between 
the wires for writing new code and wires for the CPU reading its instructions.

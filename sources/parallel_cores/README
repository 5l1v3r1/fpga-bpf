This wires up N packetfilter_cores in parallel, using a snoop_arb and fwd_arb 
in order to hook up the correct filter to the snooper/forwarder:

We really would like the packet filter to run at line rate, but if the BPF 
program is very complicated (i.e. takes many cycles), this might not be 
possible. So the packet filter has a parameter to control the number of 
parallel packetfilter_cores.

In true FPGA fashion, we parallelize what can be parallelized! Note that 
parallelizing snoopers/forwarders has zero benefit if they can already run at 
line rate.

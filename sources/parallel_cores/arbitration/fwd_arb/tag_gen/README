Since Verilog is not the greatest programming language, doing fiddly
compiler-time calculations is not the easiest. 

In a pipelined multiplexer (generalized to have N choices), and where 
it is structured as a 4-ary MUX tree, you need to generate the select
lines for each input. Example for N = 10:



                                             |
                                           __|__
                                          /_____\ height = 0
                                          | | | |
                       +----------------------+ |
                       |                  | |   |
                       |          +-------------+
                     __|__      __|__     | |
                    /_____\    /_____\    | |     height = 1
                    | | | |    | | | |    | |
   Input:           0 1 2 3    4 5 6 7    8 9

                   +-------------------------+
   Select lines:   |1 1 1 1    1 1 1 1    0 0| \ For MUX at height 0
                   |0 0 0 0    1 1 1 1    0 1| /
                   |                         |
                   |0 0 1 1    0 0 1 1    d d| \ For MUX at height 1
                   |0 1 0 1    0 1 0 1    d d| /
                   +-------------------------+
                    (---Long path----)    (-)
                                           |
                                           +---> Short path

Taking input 5 as an example, in the column below it we see 1101, and
that is a "long path". This means that the select lines for the top
MUX are '11' and the select lines for the bottom MUX are '01'. Since 
it is a long path, the select lines for the top MUX are delayed by one
extra cycle.

Taking input 9 as another example, in the column below it we see 01dd,
and that is a "short path". This means the select lines for the top
MUX are '01', and that we don't care about the select lines for the
bottom MUX. Since it is a short path, we can wire the top MUX select
lines directly.

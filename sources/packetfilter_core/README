These files form the "packet filter core". Essentially, this is the common 
denominator to all the different variations you can make of the packet filter.

                           Packet filter core


The exposed interface is:

 - A "BRAM slave" interface to plug in a snooper 
 - A "BRAM slave" interface to plug in a forwarder
 - A "BRAM slave" interface to write new instructions to the code memory
 - A couple of reset and handshaking signals

First of all, the "BRAM" interfaces are a little non-standard; I add some extra 
sidechannels for keeping track of the lengths in memory.

When you ask for a bunch of parallel processors, it is this packetfilter_core 
module that gets replicated.

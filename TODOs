Need documentation for:
    - sources/packetfilter_core/p3/muxes
    - sources/packetfilter_core/p3/agent_adapters

Need to update documentation for:
    - sources/packetfilter_core/bpfcpu/controller

Still need to implement:
    - Arbiters (+explain new tag tree method)
    - Snooper (probably will need to redo it)
    - Forwarder (ditto)
    - AXI Lite interface to load new memory (can mostly copy from old project)
    - Tcl script to have Vivado generate an IP (can mostly copy from old project)

Other:
    - The job queues in p3ctrl really need an overhaul
    - Need to find a clean way to gate hot signals in speculative execution
    - Migrate old readme and wiki pages to new repo (making changes as needed)
    - Add caching to cpu_adapter
    - Add capability to return only subset of a packet
      -> Have the return valu overwrite the packet byte length if it is smaller
